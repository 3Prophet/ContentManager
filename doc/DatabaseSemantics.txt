-------------------------FIRST ITERATION

+ A Booking migh have Files associated with it
+  	 A File can't exist without a corresponding Booking

- Every File has an Owner - User, who uploads it
- 	File can't exist without an Owner
-	Owner can't exist without a File
-	Ownership can't exist without both File and(or) Owner
		
- Owner assigns different permissions to Users. 
	Owner can't exist without being a User
	
User is either and individual user or an user group.

Permission exists only if User exists,
 if File exists and Owner exists
 
 
 As soon as the Booking will be deleted all the entries... responsibility of the client to take care of the folder

-----------------------FINAL ITERATION -----------------------------------

A Booking might have Files associated with it
	A File can't exist without a corresponding Booking (N:1)
	If the booking is deleted the file is deleted.
	If the file is removed it is marked as deleted.
	File is weak entity. 
	
files_booking([bkg_id, file_id], filename,
			 path, is_folder, is_deleted);	
	
File can be uploaded and reuploaded by multiple Users (M:N)
	Upload relation can't exist without a File (marked as deleted)
	If file is deleted the corresponding uploads are deleted too.
	If file is removed the corresponding uploads are marked as deleted.
uploads_booking([bkg_id, file_id, user_is])	
	
Permission to File can be assigned to Users / UserGroups (M:N:K)
It is not specified who assigns them -it is of the application's concern
	Permission can't exit without either a User a File or a Booking 
	Permission is a weak entity
	If File is removed the booking is deleted
	If File is marked as removed the Permission is marked as deleted.
files:permissions_users, permissions_groups
	
	
Problems:
1. Foreign key constraint insertion (when linking 2 databases with different engines). The issue is discussed here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9018584/error-code-1005-cant-create-table-errno-150


2. Composite key with one of the column being 
 automatically enumerated and values of this column being
  automatically updated if say one of the rows is deleted:

Should we include update history just like uploads?
Using transactions by FileManager:

If file is deleted the database should not delete the entry in database (what if it was renamed by say a virus)
